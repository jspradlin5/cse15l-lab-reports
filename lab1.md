When using the command 'cd' with no arguments, the path does not change at all since there were no arguments included. This command takes you to your home directory. It's not an error, and the output will be the contents of your home directory.

example 2, using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:

When using the command 'cd' with a path to the lecture1 directory as an argument, there is no output when the code is executed, but terminal is now in a different directory as can be seen when checking the path after the command.This command changes the working directory to the specified directory. It's not an error, and you'll be taken into that directory, specifically the lecture1 directory for this example.
